# Expression

In Rust, every expression returns a value. However, we don't always leverage that value. Thus, we've two _types_ of expressions:
1. AE, an assigning expression
2. ITEE, an "into the ether" expression

For (1) we should pass in label to assign to. For (2) we don't need to assign anything.
